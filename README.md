# Nonergodicity code

This code accompanies the paper "The influence of dietary carbohydrate on perceived recovery status differs at the group and individual level â€“ evidence of nonergodicity among endurance athletes".

Data from the study is still being used and analyzed for other purposes, so **a synthetic version of the dataset was created using the {synthpop} pacakge for purposes of running the code.**
